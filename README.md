This script computes seasonal vegetation and temperature indices for a specified region of interest (ROI) for the year 2024. 
It leverages MODIS satellite datasets to calculate NDVI, LST, and derived indices: VCI, TCI, and VHI. 
The script also generates seasonal mean maps and supports exporting these indices to Google Drive for further analysis.
The main purpose of this workflow is to monitor vegetation health and drought conditions across wet and dry seasons.
